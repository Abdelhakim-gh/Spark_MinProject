<p>[Note: I have not yet provided the answers for these. I will be adding them shortly. I will notify you once the answers are added]</p><p>&nbsp; Programming has drastically changed in the last few years. Instead of memorizing the syntax of one language, developers use many languages and don't need to remember the syntax. They formulate the logical plan for solving a problem and then find required syntax by googling and finding syntax on language reference sites or sites like github and stackOveflow. This has many advantages and also disadvantage of sometimes using bad code as well. Following activities may use features that may not have been covered in he class but I am sure you can find out how to solve them.</p><p><br></p><p>6.1. Write a class similar to IntStack in Scala to implement a queue using List. Queue has three methods:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; enqueue(Int)&nbsp; : Add the given integer at the end of the queue</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Int dequeue() : Remove and return the integer from beginning of queue</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; isEmpty()&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: return true if queue is empty, otherwise false.</p><p>[ Note: Scala does have builtin libraries for queues and stacks]</p><p> 6.2. Extend the above class to add the toString method.</p><p> 6.3. Write a function that takes a list and returns another list with elements sorted in descending order.</p><p> 6.4. Write a function that takes a string containing colon separated list of words and returns a string with the words in sorted order separated by comma, after removing the duplicates.</p><p> 6.5. Write a function that takes a string that contains comma separated list of integers and returns the minimum and maximum values. For example, for a string "30,20,15,45,60" , it should return (15,60)</p><p> 6.6. Create an array of first 10 odd numbers and write statements to print the sum of first n elements of the array, for n from 1 to 10.</p><p> 6.7. Create and test anonymous functions that take two numbers and return the largest and smallest of them.</p><p> 6.8. Maps : You can use:</p><p> val rand = scala.util.Random</p><p> var x = rand.nextInt(100)</p><p> to create a random integer less than 100</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; Use this method to create a map containing numbers from 1 to 10 as keys and each key mapped to two random values less than 100 (Use a tuple for values). Now write a function that takes this map and the first value as parameter and returns the list of second values from the map. Note that same first value may have multiple second values in the map. For example if (1-&gt;(23,30) and 5-&gt;(23,44) are in the map, then given 23, return List(30,44)</p><p><br></p><p>6.9. Options : For optional values, instead of using null, you can use Option type in Scala. A variable of Option type can have two values Some(x) where x is the actual value or None indicating no value. Maps have a get method which returns Some(value) if the given key has a value in the map and otherwise None. Modify the program in example 8 above to have 100 elements in the map instead of 10. Write a function that takes a random integer&nbsp; between one and 200, if the passed integer is a key in the map, then it returns the sum of the tuple entries otherwise returns the Option None. For example if passed 10 and 10-&gt;(43,67) is in the map, then it returns Some(110), if passed 200 it will return None. [Note: match is used to check for Option type value] </p><p>6.10.Create a case class hospitalRecord with three fields customer id, visit date and symptoms as string. The symptoms is used as a list of symptoms separated by a colon. Write a function that takes this class and a symptom and returns true if the provided symptom is part of the symptoms in the object.</p><p>6.11. Create a case class purchaseRecord with three fields product name, purchase price and purchase date. Create an object of this class and use copy method to create more objects of this class. Write a function that takes an object of this class and a pattern and returns Option type of None if the product name does not match the pattern and Option type with the product price if the product name matches the pattern. </p><p>6.12.Create a class salesRecord with four fields item name, sale date, number of items and purchase amount. Create a companion object for this class that keeps track of number of times an item has been purchased. </p><p>6.13. Add a function filter to above class that takes a function returning Boolean as parameter. It calls the function passed with the parameter item name of the object and returns the return value from the function. Try the filter function with some anonymous function as parameter.</p><p>6.14. In exercise 1, you created a class to implement a queue. Add a function map to the above class that takes a function as parameter. The map should apply the function to every member of the queue and create a new queue with the results. </p><p>6.15. Add a function filter to the above class that takes a Boolean function as parameter and returns a new queue by applying the function to every element of the queue and taking only the elements that return true. For example if the queue has elements (10,14,15,17,5) and the parameter passed is _ % 2&nbsp; == 1 , then it should return new queue with elements(15,17,5)</p><p><br></p>
