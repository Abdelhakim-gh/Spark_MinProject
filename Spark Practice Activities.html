Filter the records that have price &gt; 100 and print the RDD.</p><p>7.2&nbsp; Read the hospital record as an RDD. Create another RDD by removing the duplicates from the symptoms. save this RDD as a file in HDFS.</p><p>7.3&nbsp; Read the purchase record as a dataframe. select only first two columns and show the results.</p><p>7.4 Read the hospital record as a dataframe. write a query to find out the number of visits by each patient.</p><p>7.5 Store the results of the above dataframe as a parquet table.</p><p>7.6 Modify query in 7.4 to order the results in descending order of the count.</p><p>7.7 Write a method that takes hospital records dataframe and a number and returns the top n number of symptoms. You have done similar mapreduce job in section 4.8.</p><p>7.8 Use window operations on the hospital record dataframe to add the number previous visits by a patient to each visit record. This will be 0 for the first visit. Then write a query to list the customers who have visited more than once. Check the sql plan for this query in the web-interface.</p><p>7.9 Modify the parameters maxPartitionBytes and shuffle.partitions to smaller values and check the query respons for queries in 7.8</p><p>7.10 Create a case class for the purchase record read in 7.3 and convert the dataframe to a dataset. Filter the records with price &gt; 100.</p><p>7.11 Create a case class for the hospital records read in 7.4. Use a map to create another dataset with duplicates removed from list of symptoms.</p><p>7.12 create tables in hive from purchase record (PurchaseRecords) and hospital record (HospitalRecords) data frames.</p><p>7.13 Create an UDF that removes the duplicates from colon separated symptoms string. Use&nbsp; this UDF in a sql query on HospitalRecords table.&nbsp; </p><p>7.14 Write an sql query on PurchaseRecord table that shows maximum purchase price for each product.</p><p>7.15 Create a map that gives a list of illnesses for each symptom. For example "fever"-&gt;"Flu", </p><p>"runny nose"-&gt;"cold". Use this map to write an UDF that takes a colon separated list of symptoms and suggests an illness as diagnosis. Use this udf with the hospital records to add a first diagnosis illness to each record. Remember to use broadcast variables and serialize the class.</p>
